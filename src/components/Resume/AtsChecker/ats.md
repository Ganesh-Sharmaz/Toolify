## ATS Score: 65/100

**Strengths:**

* **Targeted Keywords:** The resume effectively uses relevant keywords like "React.js," "Node.js," "Express.js," "MongoDB," "Frontend," "Backend," "MERN Stack," "JavaScript," "Python," "Data Science," and "Cloudinary." 
* **Quantifiable Achievements:** The projects section showcases concrete achievements with numbers, demonstrating impact and value. For example, "30% increase in user engagement," "25% enhancement in user satisfaction," "40% improvement in user functionality," and "20% improvement in application performance."
* **Skill Listing:**  The resume effectively lists relevant technical skills in a separate section, making it easier for ATS to scan and identify matching keywords.

**Areas to Improve:**

* **Buzzwords:**  The resume heavily relies on buzzwords like "forward-thinking," "invaluable," "drive innovation," "seamless," "intuitive," "streamlined," and "progressive." These terms are vague and don't add value.
* **Impact Words:** While the resume uses quantifiable metrics, it could further enhance impact by using stronger verbs and action-oriented language. For example, instead of "enabled standard QR code generation," consider "developed a feature for standard QR code generation."
* **Project Descriptions:** The descriptions often focus on the technical aspects of the projects rather than the actual impact and achievements. Focus more on the "what" and "why" of the project and how it benefited users or the organization. 
* **Certifications:** The certifications section needs to be more concise and relevant. Include only the most relevant certifications and mention their relevance to the target roles.
* **Redundancy:**  The resume mentions "Frontend" and "Backend" separately in the skills section. Consider combining them as "Full-Stack Development."
* **Formatting:**  The use of underscores and inconsistencies in font size for headings makes the resume look unprofessional.

**Tips to Get Hired:**

1. **Tailor Your Resume:**  Always tailor your resume to the specific job description and company you are applying to. Highlight the skills and experiences that align most closely with their requirements.
2. **Network:**  Networking is crucial. Attend industry events, connect with professionals on LinkedIn, and reach out to people in your desired field. Networking can lead to valuable insights and potential job opportunities.
